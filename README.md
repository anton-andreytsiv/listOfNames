Welcome to my test project.

To start project download it.

For work you need to use Docker

Start comand $ docker compose up --build

It will start 3 containers: node (backend part), postgres_db (database) and client (frondend part)

client start at localhost:8080

You need to registrate your account. Then log in and you can sort names in list by drag and drop.
